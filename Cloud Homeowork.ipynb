    "A company that could use this ML app is a food safety and inspection agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Inspectors and scientists in the FDA could use this app to rapidly assess the safety of various mushrooms collected during field inspections. By inputting features like cap diameter, cap shape, gill attachment, gill color, stem height, stem width, stem color, and the season into the app, employees can quickly obtain a likelihood that a particular mushroom is poisonous. This tool can significantly enhance the efficiency and accuracy of their inspections, allowing them to make informed decisions and take swift action to prevent the distribution of potentially hazardous mushrooms. This would not only protect public health but also streamline the inspection process, making it more effective and resource-efficient."
